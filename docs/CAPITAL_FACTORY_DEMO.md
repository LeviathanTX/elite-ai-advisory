## Demo Script (15-20 minutes)

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Hook:**
"How many of you have wished you could get advice from Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, or Reid Hoffman? What if you could have all of them on your board of advisors, available 24/7?"

**Problem Statement:**
"As founders, we face critical decisions daily:
- Should I pivot my business model?
- Is my pitch investor-ready?
- What metrics should I track?
- How do I scale my team?

Traditional advisors are expensive, hard to access, and rarely available when you need them most. That's why I built Elite AI Advisory."

**Solution:**
"Elite AI Advisory gives you instant access to a world-class board of advisors, powered by AI. Think of it as having your own personal board meeting, anytime, anywhere."

## Handling Questions

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this just ChatGPT?"**
A: "No. We've built specialized advisors with specific personas, knowledge bases, and frameworks. Plus, we have purpose-built features like pitch practice with audio analysis and document processing that ChatGPT doesn't offer."

**Q: "How accurate is the advice?"**
A: "Our advisors are trained on extensive knowledge including startup frameworks, VC criteria, and best practices. However, they should complement, not replace, human advisors for critical decisions. Think of it as smart research assistant + first-pass advisor."

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
A: "Your data is encrypted, never shared with third parties, and never used to train models without your consent. We're SOC 2 compliant and take security seriously."

**Q: "Can I cancel anytime?"**
A: "Yes, cancel anytime. No contracts, no commitments. We also offer a 14-day money-back guarantee."

**Q: "Will this replace human advisors?"**
A: "No, it complements them. Use Elite AI Advisory for:
- Quick questions and brainstorming
- Practice and preparation
- First-pass analysis
- 24/7 availability

Then bring refined questions and decisions to human advisors for validation and relationship building."

**Q: "What makes this better than free AI tools?"**
A: "Three things:
1. **Specialized Features** - Pitch practice with audio analysis, due diligence frameworks, document processing
2. **Purpose-Built Advisors** - Not generic AI, but advisors with specific expertise
3. **Startup Focus** - Everything is optimized for founder needs, not general Q&A"

**Q: "Do you have investors?"**
A: "We're currently in beta with 150 users and $15K MRR. Seeking seed funding to scale. We'd love to talk to anyone interested in the AI + SaaS space."
