# AI-BoD: 30-Day Marketing Plan
## Capital Factory Slack + LinkedIn Strategy

**Target**: 50+ trial signups, 15+ paid conversions from Capital Factory founders
**Channels**: Capital Factory Slack + LinkedIn (organic)
**Timeline**: Days 1-30
**Budget**: $0 (100% organic, founder-to-founder strategy)

---

## Executive Summary

This 30-day plan uses **Jason Calacanis's founder-to-founder selling strategy** and **Barbara Corcoran's social proof tactics** to acquire the first 50 Capital Factory founder customers for AI-BoD.

**Core Philosophy**: Founders trust other founders. Every post, message, and interaction should feel like peer-to-peer value sharing, not sales pitches.

**Key Metrics**:
- Capital Factory Slack messages: 12 posts over 30 days
- LinkedIn posts: 20 posts (mix of content types)
- 1-on-1 founder outreach: 30 personalized messages
- **Goal**: 50 trial signups → 15 paid conversions (30% conversion rate)

---

## Part 1: Capital Factory Slack Strategy

### Pre-Launch (Before Day 1)

**Setup Tasks**:
- [ ] Get permission from Capital Factory team to post in Slack
- [ ] Identify key channels: #general, #fundraising, #startups, #pitch-practice
- [ ] Research 30 active founders currently fundraising (LinkedIn stalking)
- [ ] Prepare free value offerings (pitch analysis, deck reviews)
- [ ] Create "AI-BoD Demo" account credentials for easy testing

---

### Week 1 (Days 1-7): Soft Launch + Value Offering

#### Day 1 - Monday, 9:00 AM - #general channel
**TYPE**: Soft introduction + Free value offer

**POST**:
```
Hey Capital Factory founders! 👋

I'm testing a new AI tool that helps founders practice investor pitches and get feedback from virtual versions of Mark Cuban, Reid Hoffman, and other top investors.

**Free offer**: I'll analyze the first 10 founders' pitches (audio or deck) this week and share detailed feedback. No catch, just testing the product and want your honest reactions.

Drop a 🚀 if you're raising capital in the next 6 months and want in.

(Also happy to demo it live if anyone's around Capital Factory this week!)

-[Your Name], Fellow CF Founder
```

**Expected Engagement**: 5-10 reactions, 3-5 DMs
**Follow-up**: DM each responder within 2 hours with personalized pitch analysis offer

---

#### Day 3 - Wednesday, 2:00 PM - #fundraising channel
**TYPE**: Problem-solution story

**POST**:
```
Random thought: I've pitched to 47 investors in the past 6 months.

The #1 thing that helped me wasn't more pitch deck iterations—it was practicing OUT LOUD 20+ times and getting feedback on my delivery, pacing, and confidence.

Problem: I didn't have a coach, and recording myself felt awkward.

Solution I found: AI-powered pitch analysis (like having Mark Cuban critique your pitch at 2 AM on a Sunday).

Anyone else struggling with pitch practice? What's your approach?
```

**Expected Engagement**: 8-12 comments
**Follow-up**: Engage with every comment, offer demo to interested founders

---

#### Day 5 - Friday, 10:00 AM - #general channel
**TYPE**: Success story tease

**POST**:
```
Week 1 update on the AI pitch coach experiment:

Analyzed 8 founders' pitches so far. Common themes:
1. Everyone says "um" way more than they think (avg 23 times in 3 min)
2. Most founders bury the lead—traction should come FIRST
3. Energy drops in the middle (classic 2-min slump)

Most interesting: One founder practiced 12 times this week with the AI feedback, completely transformed their delivery.

Sending DMs to the 2 remaining "first 10" spots if you want pitch feedback!
```

**Expected Engagement**: Builds FOMO, credibility
**Follow-up**: DM 2 more founders (total 10), collect testimonials

---

### Week 2 (Days 8-14): Social Proof + Public Results

#### Day 8 - Monday, 11:00 AM - #fundraising channel
**TYPE**: Testimonial share + soft CTA

**POST**:
```
Got permission to share this from [Founder Name]:

"I was skeptical about AI advisors, but I practiced my pitch 15 times with AI Mark Cuban. The feedback was brutally honest (in a good way).

Fixed my pacing, cut 47 'ums', and restructured my value prop. Pitched to 3 VCs last week, got 2 follow-ups. Not sure if it's coincidence, but I'm way more confident now."

This is why I built AI-BoD—founders need pitch practice that's:
✅ Available 24/7
✅ Brutally honest
✅ Actually affordable

I'm opening up beta access to 20 more Capital Factory founders this week (trying to keep it small for now). DM me if you're fundraising and want in.

Link: [ai-bod.com/capital-factory]
```

**Expected Engagement**: 10-15 reactions, 5-8 DMs
**Follow-up**: Respond to all DMs within 1 hour, offer founder pricing

---

#### Day 10 - Wednesday, 3:00 PM - #startups channel
**TYPE**: Educational content + soft product mention

**POST**:
```
The 3-minute investor pitch formula I learned from pitching 50+ times:

**0:00-0:30** - Problem (make them feel the pain)
**0:30-1:00** - Solution (your product in one sentence)
**1:00-1:30** - Traction (numbers, logos, proof)
**1:30-2:00** - Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
**2:00-2:30** - Competitive advantage (why you'll win)
**2:30-3:00** - Ask (how much, what for)

Most founders mess up the order or spend too long on the problem.

Pro tip: Record yourself and watch it back. You'll catch things you'd never notice while presenting.

(Or use AI pitch analysis if you want instant feedback—happy to share the tool I built)
```

**Expected Engagement**: High engagement (educational content)
**Follow-up**: Founders asking about the tool → send demo link

---

#### Day 12 - Friday, 9:00 AM - #general channel
**TYPE**: Milestone + gratitude

**POST**:

### Week 3 (Days 15-21): Founder-to-Founder Selling

#### Day 15 - Monday, 10:00 AM - #fundraising channel
**TYPE**: Case study

**POST**:
```
Case Study: How [Founder Name] used AI-BoD to close their seed round

Background:
- SaaS startup, pre-revenue
- Pitching to 15 Austin VCs
- Nervous about delivery, not a "natural" presenter

What they did:
1. Uploaded pitch deck → Got AI feedback on structure
2. Practiced pitch 23 times with AI Mark Cuban
3. Fixed pacing, eliminated filler words, restructured value prop
4. Recorded final version to share with investors

Result:
- Closed $1.2M seed round from Austin Ventures
- 3 other term sheets

Their quote: "The AI feedback was as good as my $5K pitch coach, but available at 2 AM when I couldn't sleep."

This is what AI-BoD is for—making world-class pitch coaching accessible to everyone.

Beta access still open for Capital Factory founders: [link]
```

**Expected Engagement**: 15-20 reactions, 10+ DMs
**Follow-up**: Convert interested founders to paid users

#### Day 17 - Wednesday, 2:00 PM - #startups channel
**TYPE**: Behind-the-scenes + authenticity

**POST**:
```
Founder confession: I almost gave up on AI-BoD last week.

Had 3 users report bugs, 2 founders said "it's not as good as a human coach," and I questioned if this whole thing was worth it.

Then I got this message from [Founder Name]:

"Dude, I practiced my pitch 31 times with your AI Mark Cuban. I know it's not perfect, but it helped me more than my $300/hr pitch coach. Closed my seed round yesterday. Thank you."

This is why we build.

If you're a Capital Factory founder working on something hard, keep going. Happy to chat if you need a pep talk (or want to try AI-BoD for pitch practice 😊).
```

**Expected Engagement**: High engagement (vulnerability + authenticity)
**Follow-up**: Build deeper relationships with founders

#### Day 24 - Wednesday, 3:00 PM - #general channel
**TYPE**: FAQ + objection handling

**POST**:
```
Top 5 questions I'm getting about AI-BoD:

**Q: "Is this just ChatGPT?"**
A: Nope. AI-BoD has:
- Custom prompts trained on each advisor's investment thesis
- Memory of your business across conversations

A: Do both! AI-BoD is 10x cheaper and available 24/7. Use it for daily practice, save human advisors for strategic decisions.

**Q: "Does it actually work?"**
A: 47 Capital Factory founders are using it. 3 have closed funding rounds in the past month (correlation ≠ causation, but still cool).

**Q: "What if I don't like it?"**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

Thank you, Capital Factory.

When I started building AI-BoD 6 months ago, I had no idea if founders would actually use AI for pitch practice and strategic advice.

Then 50 of you tried it. You sent feedback, reported bugs, shared success stories, and told your founder friends.

**Some wins from this month:**
- 3 seed rounds closed (Sarah, Marcus, Amy)
- 8 pitch decks redesigned based on AI feedback
- 12 founders said they "saved hours on strategic planning"
- 340+ pitch practices (that's a LOT of "ums" eliminated 😅)

**What's next:**
- Adding Gordon Daugherty (Austin investor) as an advisor
- Building team features (share advisors with co-founders)
- Improving pitch analysis (better feedback on body language)

If you're using AI-BoD, thank you for building this with me.

If you're not, but you're curious—demo link: [ai-bod.com/demo]

### Week 1 LinkedIn Posts

#### Day 1 - Monday
**TYPE**: Personal Story + Soft Launch

**POST**:
```
I pitched to 47 investors before I realized the problem wasn't my idea—it was my delivery.

I said "um" 23 times in 3 minutes. My energy dropped halfway through. I buried my traction slide.

So I did something unconventional: I practiced my pitch 20+ times with an AI version of Mark Cuban.

Sounds weird, but it worked. Got 2 term sheets the next week.

That's why I built AI-BoD—AI advisors that help founders practice pitches, refine strategy, and move faster.

Slide 5: 1:30-2:00 - Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

Slide 6: 2:30-3:00 - Ask (how much, what for)

Caption:
After pitching 50+ times, I learned that structure matters more than passion.

Most founders spend too long on the problem (investors already get it) and not enough on traction (investors want proof).

"I practiced my pitch 47 times with AI Mark Cuban. Raised $2M two weeks later."

- Sarah Chen, Founder @ FinFlow (Capital Factory '24)

When Sarah first told me this, I thought it was luck.

Then Marcus said he cut his strategic planning time by 80% using AI-BoD.

Then Amy redesigned her entire pitch deck based on AI feedback and secured Series A.

I'm starting to think this AI advisor thing actually works.

If you're a founder struggling with:
- Pitch practice
- Strategic clarity
- Decision paralysis

Maybe give AI advisors a shot.

Building in public: AI-BoD user stats (Month 1)

👥 50 founders signed up
🎤 340 pitch practices recorded
📄 89 document analyses completed
💰 3 funding rounds closed (correlation ≠ causation, but cool)

Top questions I'm getting:

1. "Is this just ChatGPT?" → Nope. Custom advisor prompts + pitch analysis + document uploads
2. "Does it actually work?" → 47 Capital Factory founders think so
3. "Can I talk to a human advisor too?" → Yes! AI complements human advisors, doesn't replace them

What I'm learning:
- Founders want brutally honest feedback (AI doesn't sugarcoat)
- Pitch practice is more important than pitch deck design
- People are way more comfortable with AI than I expected

The #1 mistake founders make when pitching:

They don't practice OUT LOUD.

You can iterate your deck 47 times, but if you've never actually delivered the pitch, you're going to:
- Stumble over your words
- Lose energy halfway through
- Say "um" 20+ times
- Forget your key points

Here's what works:

1. Record yourself (phone camera is fine)
2. Watch it back (painful but necessary)
3. Fix the obvious issues (pacing, energy, filler words)
4. Repeat 10-15 times

Bonus: Get feedback from someone who's NOT your co-founder (they're too nice)

How do you practice your pitches? Drop your method below.

I almost gave up on AI-BoD last week.

3 bug reports. 2 founders said "it's not as good as a human coach." I questioned if anyone actually wanted this.

This is why we build.

To the founders who are struggling right now:
- Your idea isn't dumb

- Your product isn't too simple

Keep going. Someone needs what you're building.

Top 5 Questions I'm Getting About AI Business Advisors:

**Q: "Does AI actually understand my business?"**
A: It remembers every conversation, learns your context, and applies advisor-specific frameworks.

A: 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

A: Yep! 7-day free trial + demo account.

**The Numbers:**
- 50 beta users (all Capital Factory founders)
- 340 pitch practices
- 89 document analyses
- 3 funding rounds closed
- 15 paid subscribers

**The Lessons:**
1. Founders want brutal honesty (AI doesn't sugarcoat)
2. Practice > Perfection (repetition beats deck design)
3. Social proof > Features (testimonials converted better than feature lists)
4. Community > Marketing (founder-to-founder trust is everything)

**The Surprises:**
- People are WAY more comfortable with AI than I expected
- Pitch practice is more valuable than I thought
- Founders will pay for time savings (not just features)

**What's Next:**
- Adding Gordon Daugherty (Austin investor) as an advisor
- Building team features (share advisors with co-founders)
- Expanding beyond Austin (YC, Techstars networks)

Thank you to everyone who believed in this when it was just an idea.

Hey [Name],

Saw you're fundraising for [Company Name]—congrats on the momentum!

Would you be open to a free pitch analysis? I can send you AI feedback on your delivery + deck structure in ~10 minutes. No catch, just want to help fellow CF founders.

Curious if you have a system that works for you or if you'd want to try the AI advisor approach?

Happy to share what I've learned either way.

Would you want me to run your deck through it? I can send you VC-grade feedback in about 15 minutes. Totally free, just helping fellow Capital Factory founders.

Let me know!
