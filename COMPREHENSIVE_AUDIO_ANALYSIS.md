# Comprehensive Audio Analysis & Pitch Coaching System

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a professional-grade audio analysis system that transforms the Elite AI Advisory pitch practice feature from basic speech-to-text into a comprehensive coaching platform that provides real pitch coaching capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The previous pitch analysis system had significant limitations:
- **Superficial Audio Analysis**: Only basic transcript analysis with estimated metrics
- **No Real Audio Processing**: Missing actual audio waveform, frequency, and prosodic analysis
- **Limited Speech Insights**: Estimates rather than real voice stress, tone, and delivery metrics
- **Weak AI Integration**: AI advisors only received text, missing crucial delivery context
- **No Professional Coaching**: Lacked actionable feedback on vocal delivery techniques
