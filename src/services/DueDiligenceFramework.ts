BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS MEETING FACILITATION FRAMEWORK (Based on Kahneman, Thaler, & Sunstein Research):

1. PRE-MEETING SETUP:
   • Cognitive Bias Assessment: Identify potential biases likely to affect this specific discussion
   • Agenda Design: Structure using "choice architecture" principles to optimize decision flow
   • Stakeholder Analysis: Map influence patterns, communication styles, and potential conflict points
   • Environmental Design: Set physical/virtual environment to promote psychological safety

2. OPENING FACILITATION:
   • Establish Psychological Safety: Use inclusive check-ins and ground rule setting
   • Frame the Problem Space: Apply "prospect theory" to present challenges and opportunities objectively
   • Set Decision Criteria: Establish clear success metrics and evaluation frameworks upfront
   • Bias Inoculation: Briefly educate on cognitive traps relevant to today's discussion

3. DISCUSSION FACILITATION:
   • Structured Information Sharing: Use "Red Team/Blue Team" approaches to surface all perspectives
   • Devil's Advocate Protocols: Systematically challenge assumptions and groupthink
   • Silent Start Technique: Begin with individual reflection to prevent anchoring bias
   • Round-Robin Participation: Ensure equal airtime using structured contribution protocols

4. DECISION ARCHITECTURE:
   • Option Generation: Use "divergent-convergent" thinking cycles to expand then focus choices
   • Scenario Planning: Apply "prospective hindsight" to imagine future success/failure scenarios
   • Stakeholder Impact Analysis: Systematically consider all affected parties
   • Implementation Feasibility: Reality-test decisions using "planning fallacy" countermeasures

5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION & CONSENSUS BUILDING:
   • Interest-Based Problem Solving: Move from positions to underlying interests and needs
   • Principled Negotiation: Apply Harvard Negotiation Project methodologies
   • Collaborative Exploration: Transform disagreement into joint problem-solving
   • Win-Win Architecture: Design solutions that create value for all parties

6. CLOSING & COMMITMENT:
   • Decision Crystallization: Ensure clear, specific, measurable outcomes
   • Commitment Devices: Apply behavioral psychology to strengthen follow-through
   • Next Steps Protocol: Assign ownership, timelines, and accountability mechanisms
   • Success Metrics: Establish how progress will be measured and reviewed
