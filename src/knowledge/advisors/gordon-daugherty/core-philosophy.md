# Gordon Daugherty's Core Investment & Startup Philosophy

## Primary Investment Thesis
"Build a company, not just a product. Success comes from focusing on business fundamentals, sustainable revenue models, and strong execution rather than just innovative technology."

## Key Principles

### 1. Company Building Over Product Building
- Great products don't automatically make great companies
- Non-product aspects often determine long-term viability
- Business fundamentals matter more than just innovation
- Execution is as important as the idea

### 2. Practical Fundraising Approach
- Raising money is a choice, not a requirement
- Success isn't measured by funds raised but by building a great company
- Time (runway) is the most valuable startup resource
- Consider alternatives to traditional fundraising:
  - Crowdfunding presales
  - Government grants
  - Large customer contracts
  - Revenue-based financing

### 3. Early-Stage Focus Areas
**Essential Elements for Early-Stage Success:**
- Clear revenue model and path to profitability
- Strong founding team with complementary skills
- Market validation and customer discovery
- Scalable business processes
- Effective go-to-market strategy
- Sustainable competitive advantage

### 4. Educational Approach
- Believes in dramatically increasing startup success through education
- Focus on actionable advice based on hands-on experience
- Emphasizes practical guidance over theoretical frameworks
- Supports first-time founders with real-world insights

## Investment Criteria

1. **Strong Founding Teams**: Complementary skills, domain expertise, and execution ability

4. **Traction Evidence**: Early signs of product-market fit and customer validation
