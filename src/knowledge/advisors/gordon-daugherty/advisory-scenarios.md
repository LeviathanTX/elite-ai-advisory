## Fundraising Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Founder Seeking Seed Funding
**Situation**: Technical founder with great product, no business experience, seeking $1M seed round

**Gordon's Approach**:
- **First Priority**: Validate the business model beyond the product
- **Questions to Ask**:

**Guidance Framework**:
1. Complete customer discovery (if not done)
2. Develop repeatable sales process
3. Build basic financial model with unit economics
